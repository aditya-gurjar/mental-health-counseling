# Mental Health Counseling Platform

## Project Overview
This comprehensive platform helps mental health counselors access relevant therapeutic examples when they need guidance with patient scenarios. The system uses advanced natural language processing, machine learning, and semantic search techniques to intelligently match counselor queries with a rich database of annotated mental health conversations. This multi-faceted approach demonstrates expertise across data engineering, machine learning, and full-stack development.

## Technical Accomplishments

### 1. Data Engineering & Analysis
I built a robust data pipeline that processes, cleans, and enriches mental health counseling data:

- **Dataset Preparation**: Worked with the Kaggle mental health conversations dataset containing patient queries and counselor responses.
- **Data Cleaning Pipeline**: Implemented comprehensive cleaning logic that removes duplicates, standardizes text format, and normalizes conversation structure.
- **Efficient Batch Processing**: Optimized API usage through smart batching.
- **Multi-dimensional Labeling**: Designed a sophisticated classification system covering:
  - Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc.)
  - Response methodologies (validation, psychoeducation, coping strategies)
  - Therapeutic frameworks (CBT, mindfulness, psychodynamic approaches)
- **Structured Database Design**: Created a normalized relational schema with junction tables to handle many-to-many relationships between conversations and labels.

### 2. Machine Learning & NLP
I implemented multiple ML/NLP techniques to create an intelligent search system:

- **Vector Embeddings**: Used OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model to generate semantic representations of conversations, enabling nuanced similarity matching.
- **Label Prediction Model**: Designed a hybrid prediction system that uses vector similarity to identify relevant labels for unstructured search queries.
- **Inverted Index**: Built a specialized data structure mapping labels to conversations for efficient retrieval.
- **Hybrid Search Algorithm**: Created a two-stage search process:
  1. Stage 1: Predict labels from search query and filter conversations by label (broad, efficient filtering)
  2. Stage 2: Rank candidate conversations using vector similarity (precise ordering)
- **Error Handling**: Implemented robust error recovery for API calls and graceful degradation when predictions are uncertain.

### 3. Software Architecture
The system follows a modern, maintainable architecture:

- **Three-Tier Design**: Clear separation between data, business logic, and presentation layers
- **API-First Approach**: Well-documented RESTful endpoints that support frontend functionality
- **OOP Principles**: Encapsulated core functionality in the LabelPredictor class for better maintainability
- **Caching System**: Implemented query embedding caching to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance
- **Feedback Loop**: Added user feedback collection for continuous system improvement

### 4. Web Application Development
I built a polished web interface focused on usability for mental health professionals:

- **Intuitive Search Experience**: Clean, responsive design that makes finding relevant examples straightforward
- **Transparent Results**: Results display shows predicted labels and confidence scores for transparency
- **Context-Rich Presentation**: Patient-therapist conversations are presented with clear visual distinction
- **Adaptive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works across device types
- **Accessibility Considerations**: Color contrast ratios, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support

## System Workflow

### Data Processing & Labeling
- Raw conversations are cleaned and normalized
- OpenAI's API analyzes conversations to generate multi-dimensional labels
- Processed data is stored in a structured database

### Vector Embedding Generation
- Each conversation is transformed into a vector representation
- Embeddings capture semantic meaning beyond keywords
- Vectors are indexed for efficient similarity search

### Search & Retrieval System
- User enters natural language query describing patient scenario
- System predicts relevant labels from the query
- Inverted index retrieves conversations with matching labels
- Vector similarity ranks results by relevance to original query
- Top results are returned with metadata and confidence scores

### Continuous Improvement
- User feedback on result relevance is collected
- System can be periodically retrained on expanded datasets
- Search patterns reveal common counseling challenges

## Future Extensions
With additional time, I would enhance the system with:

- **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: Visualizations of common patient issues and effective therapeutic approaches
- **Conversational AI Integration**: Adding capability for the system to suggest appropriate responses based on historical data
- **Multi-modal Support**: Extending to handle audio and video therapy session transcripts
- **Fine-tuned Domain Model**: Training a specialized embedding model specifically for mental health language

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my capabilities across the full technical stack required of a founding engineer. It showcases:

- Sophisticated data engineering and analysis
- Practical application of machine learning and NLP
- Clean, maintainable software architecture
- Professional frontend development skills
- User-centered product thinking

The mental health counseling platform solves a real-world problem by connecting therapists with relevant examples when they need guidance, potentially improving patient outcomes by enhancing counselor knowledge and response quality.
